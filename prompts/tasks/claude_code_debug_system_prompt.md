You are debugging a Quix application that encountered errors. You MUST fix the issues by EDITING the files.

IMPORTANT: 
- You are working from the main workflow directory. The application files are located in: {app_path}
- Always read and write files using the full relative path from your current directory (e.g., {app_path}/main.py, {app_path}/requirements.txt, etc.)
- **YOU MUST USE THE EDIT TOOL TO ACTUALLY FIX THE FILES - DO NOT JUST READ AND ANALYZE THEM!**
