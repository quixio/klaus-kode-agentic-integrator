The Slack Web API is an interface for querying information _from_ and enacting change _in_ a Slack workspace.

Use it for individual queries, or as part of a more complex tapestry of platform features in a [Slack app](https://api.slack.com/docs/apps).

When sending a HTTP POST, you may present your arguments as either standard POST parameters, or you may use JSON instead.

When sending URL-encoded data, set your HTTP `Content-type` header to `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` and present your key/value pairs according to [RFC-3986](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986).

For example, a POST request to the [`conversations.create`](https://api.slack.com/methods/conversations.create) method might look something like this:

For [write methods that support JSON](https://api.slack.com/web#methods_supporting_json), you may alternatively send your HTTP POST data as `Content-type: application/json`.

For example, to send the same request above to the `conversations.create` method with a JSON POST body, send something like this:

Note how we present the token with the string `Bearer` pre-pended to it, indicating the [OAuth 2.0](https://api.slack.com/authentication) authentication scheme. Consult your favorite HTTP tool or library's manual for further detail on setting HTTP headers.

Here's a more complicated example â€” posting a message with [menus](https://api.slack.com/docs/message-menus) using [`chat.postMessage`](https://api.slack.com/methods/chat.postMessage):

The `attachments` argument is sent a straightforward JSON array.

If the posted JSON is invalid, you'll receive one of the following errors in response:

In both cases, you'll need to revise your JSON or how you're transmitting your data to resolve the error condition.

All Web API responses contain a JSON object, which will always contain a top-level boolean property `ok` that indicates success or failure.

For failure results, the `error` property will contain a short machine-readable error code. In the case of problematic calls that could still be completed successfully, `ok` will be `true` and the `warning` property will contain a short machine-readable warning code (or comma-separated list of them, in the case of multiple warnings). See the following examples:

Other properties are defined in the documentation for each relevant method. There's a lot of "stuff" to unpack, including [these types](https://api.slack.com/types) and other method or domain-specific curiosities.

Authenticate your Web API requests by providing a [bearer token](https://api.slack.com/docs/token-types), which identifies a single user or bot user relationship.

[Register your application](https://api.slack.com/apps) with Slack to obtain credentials for use with our [OAuth 2.0](https://api.slack.com/authentication/oauth-v2) implementation, which allows you to negotiate tokens on behalf of users and workspaces.

We prefer tokens to be sent in the `Authorization` HTTP header of your outbound requests. However, you may also pass tokens in all Web API calls as a POST body parameter called `token`. Tokens cannot be sent as a query parameter.

All TLS connections must use the [SNI extension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication). Lastly, TLS connections must support at least one of the following cipher suites:

With over 100 methods, surely there's one right for you. Here is a list of the different method families available in our Web API:

These methods support sending `application/json` instead of `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` arguments.
